This activity is very small at first, and I disregarded it as a minor side-effect. However, this energy remained persistent and unwavering. A thought struck me, one which was both surprising and strong: The corpse was waiting for something.' WHERE `word_id` = 126964; -- locales_page_text - text : entry=3438
